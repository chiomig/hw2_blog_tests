## Notes

This is a sample homework solution for the Intro to Testing in Rails class. Please read through the tests in the spec directory and make sure you understand what everything means. Also review the following:
* All appropriate models in app/models (pay extra attention to validations and associations).
* All factories within spec/factories.
Think about how the tests should be written first and drive the development of all methods within the specified models.
